    My name is <em>Laila Hill-Glover.</em> My major is Digital Design! I am from New Jersey. A fun fact about me is that I am the youngest of five siblings! Two of my siblings graduated from Rodchester University! Furthermore, My passion for design stems from my love for creativity. As a high school student, I became fascinated with Adobe design software and have developed my artistic abilities over the past several years. In 2020, I launched a business called Laila’s Tree. Through Laila’s Tree, I sell T-shirts displaying my original abstract art. During my college career at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, I have honed my design skills by becoming proficient in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, and Adobe XD. I have also become proficient in color theory, art and architecture history, and UI/UX design.
